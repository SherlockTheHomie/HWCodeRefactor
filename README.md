# HWCodeRefactor
Homework assignment using semantic HTML elements to improve SEO for clients website.
After removing and changing div elements to semantic elements and fixing the CSS to return the website to it's initial appearance. I condensed the CSS to make the website more efficient in achieving the desired style and function.
Then I remembered that I needed to be using git bash. *facepalm*
